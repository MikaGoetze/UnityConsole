# UnityConsole
This is a single file debug console for Unity. This console requires literally 0 setup to work with it's default UI (an immediate mode gui), just drag the script into your project and off you go. But it can be customised to work with any UI as desired, simply by removing the DEFAULT_UI_IN_USE define. The console provides attributes to allow calling of all static functions, and setting of static variables. Most common types are supported. The console also provides an alternative to Debug.Log in Console.Log. Console.Log allows for filtering of logs by group / type (by log levels) which can be changed at runtime, but persist through a scriptable object.
